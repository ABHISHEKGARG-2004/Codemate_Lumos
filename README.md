# CodeMate Backend â€“ Phase 1

**Phase 1: Project Initialization**  
In this phase, we set up the initial backend structure for CodeMate using **Express.js**.  
This commit includes:
- Basic server configuration
- Essential project files (`index.js`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.env` placeholder)

The backend is now ready for further development such as database integration, authentication, and API endpoints in upcoming phases.
